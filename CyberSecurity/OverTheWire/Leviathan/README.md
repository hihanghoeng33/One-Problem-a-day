Special Thanks:<br>
We would like to thank AstroMonk for coming up with a replacement idea for the last level,<br>
deadfood for finding a leveljump and Coi for finding a non-planned vulnerability.<br>
<br>
Description:<br>
This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common<br>
sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no idea that it'd be this<br>
hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't require programming abilities from <br>
the players. Hopefully we made an interesting challenge for the new ones.<br>
<br>
