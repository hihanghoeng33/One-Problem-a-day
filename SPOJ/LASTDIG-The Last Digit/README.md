#number-theory #ad-hoc-1<br>

Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should 

deliver his task tomorrow. His mathâ€™s teacher gives him two numbers a and b. The problem consist of finding the last 

digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Nestor with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a

(0 <= a <= 20) and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000), a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of a^b.

<h3>Input</h3>
The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.
<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
Input:
2
3 10
6 2
  
Output:
9
6
